<p><font>This model generates lead solubility predictions using the LEADSOL (Schock et al. 1996) and minteq.v4 (Charlton and Parkhurst, 2011; Parkhurst and Appelo, 2013) databases. Lead binding to humic substances is modeled using an approximation to the Windermer Humic Aqueous Model (Tipping and Hurley, 1992; see pbcusol::eq_sol_wham()). Lead concentration is shown as a function of stagnation time inside a lead pipe using a model described by Kuch and Wagner (1983).</p>
